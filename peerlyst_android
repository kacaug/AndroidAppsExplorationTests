asus zenfone 3, android 8.0
- commenting - major delay while typing
- 'return up' button - comment textbox overlaps with it and in result its ineffective
- clear button - works only when keyboard is hidden
- <br> in commentbox - visible only during creation/editing; no actual representation within the posted comment
- scroll indicator - not visible, user is unaware of position in the context of whole 'info/posts wall'
- return to previous page after profile lookup - mostly random position is set, below the previous one
- sending msg - ??? popup does not disappear, counter is not updated
